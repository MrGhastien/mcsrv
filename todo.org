** Network
*** FIXED Legacy ping request is sent after sending the status response
CLOSED: [2024-06-15 sam. 00:20]
** FIXED Properly handle termination signals (SIGINT)
CLOSED: [2024-06-24 lun. 00:05]
Trying to interrupt with Ctrl-C does nothing.

* Features                                                            :mcsrv:
** Network
*** DONE Create a byte buffer that writes directly to a socket if possible
CLOSED: [2024-06-17 lun. 22:10]

** DONE Proper threading

- [X] Ensure no race conditions / deadlocks in the event & network subsystems.
- [X] Thread library wrapper
  Useful for setting thread names & allows for more porability
  The difficulty is the ~pthread_self~ interface
- [X] Signal handler thread
- [X] Make the logger thread-safe
  Buffer for each thread, then merge-sort style merging, sorting by time
  - [X] Create a ring buffer container
  - [X] Check if the buffer can be used with networking
  # This is overkill & i can't get it to work
  # The logger performace is only significant for debug & trace logging levels
  # - [-] Make the main  logger loop (using cond vars or sleep)
  # - [-] Refactor the ~log_msg~ functions to defer prefix & color formatting
