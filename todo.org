* Bugs                                                                :mcsrv:

** Network
*** FIXED Legacy ping request is sent after sending the status response
CLOSED: [2024-06-15 sam. 00:20]
*** FIXED All bytes of a packet are read correctly, but ~has_read_all_bytes()~ aborts the program.
CLOSED: [2024-12-08 dim. 18:01]
The functions is invalid because the byte buffer might contain multiple raw packets.
** FIXED Properly handle termination signals (SIGINT)
CLOSED: [2024-06-24 lun. 00:05]
Trying to interrupt with Ctrl-C does nothing.
** BUG Memory leak when building a new JSON object.

* Features                                                            :mcsrv:
** Internals
*** TODO Scattered vector
  Vector with a dynamic size using blocks of memory to resize itself.
** Network
*** DONE Decompression & decryption of packets
CLOSED: [2024-12-08 dim. 17:53]
*** TODO Abstraction over Linux and Windows for the network sub-system [1/2]
- [X] Linux sub-system
- [ ] Windows sub-system

** DONE Proper threading
CLOSED: [2024-06-27 jeu. 00:21]
- [X] Ensure no race conditions / deadlocks in the event & network subsystems.
- [X] Thread library wrapper
  Useful for setting thread names & allows for more portability
  The difficulty is the ~pthread_self~ interface
- [X] Signal handler thread
- [X] Make the logger thread-safe
  Buffer for each thread, then merge-sort style merging, sorting by time
  - [X] Create a ring buffer container
  - [X] Check if the buffer can be used with networking
  # This is overkill & i can't get it to work
  # The logger performance is only significant for debug & trace logging levels
  # - [-] Make the main  logger loop (using cond vars or sleep)
  # - [-] Refactor the ~log_msg~ functions to defer prefix & color formatting
*** TODO Handle more than 128 threads

** TODO Login sequence
*** DONE Protocols
CLOSED: [2024-09-21 sam. 22:04]
- [X] Mojang Auth
- [X] Encryption with OpenSSL
- [X] Compression with ZLib
*** TODO Send a `DISCONNECT` packet when a connection is closed
*** TODO Data loading / saving
- [ ] Anvil map saver & loader
  Try to come up with a better format?
- [ ] NBT saver & loader
- [ ] JSON loader


* Ideas                                                               :mcsrv:
** Ease of use
These items work hand in hand
*** Configuration interface & CLI options [0/4]
- [ ] Chose a config file format (YAML, TOML)
- [ ] IP address & port
- [ ] Max players
- [ ] Compression threshold

*** Tooling
- [ ] NBT Explorer / Editor
